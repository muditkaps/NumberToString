# NumberToString
Converting an Integer number to English words 

Given some integer (N) as an argument, return a string representation of that integer.
For example, using the capability in a scala REPL (implemented as a function called int2str) may look like this:
int2str(5)
res0: String = five

int2str(55)
res1: String = fifty-five
